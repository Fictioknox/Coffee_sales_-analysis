Here's a quick overview of the project and how I percolated through the data to uncover meaningful results. Grab a cup of your favorite brew, and let’s get started!


## Tools Used
**Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Dashboards)** <br>
**Power Query Editor (Data Transformation)** <br>

<br>

## 🎯 Purpose of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to uncover key business insights from the coffee shop’s sales data. I wanted to dig deeper into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends to brew up recommendations that can:

Boost revenue <br>
Optimize product offerings <br>
Improve customer experience <br>
Maximize store efficiency <br>

Whether it’s figuring out the best times to brew more coffee or highlighting star products, this analysis brings a full-flavored understanding of the shop’s operations!

## 2. 📋 Understanding the Data
Our dataset is like a perfectly crafted latte—it’s got all the good stuff! Here’s what’s in it:

__Transactions:__   Every sale, large or small, across different stores. <br>

**Dates & Times:** When each cup was sold—useful for identifying daily trends and rush hours. <br>

**Product Details:** From gourmet coffee to baked goods, each item has its own identity. <br>

**Locations:** Multiple stores across different areas, giving us a sense of regional performance. <br>

This rich data set is a goldmine for uncovering patterns in customer behavior and store efficiency.

## 3. 🔧 Challenges Faced
Here are some challenges I tackled:

**Editing Formats:** Standardizing date and time formats to make sure everything was in sync.<br>

**Handling Missing Values:** Like finding a misplaced sugar packet, I filled the gaps where needed and checked for any null values. (because bad data leads to bad brews).<br>

**Data Cleaning:** We removed any duplicates and irrelevant info to ensure we were working with clean, high-quality data—just like a well-brewed cup of coffee.<br>

## 4. 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
I focused on key metrics that give a snapshot of the shop’s overall performance. Here’s what I measured:

**Total Sales:** The shop's lifeblood, broken down across time frames (monthly, daily, etc.). <br>

**Total Footfall:** How many people are walking through the doors? Are they window shopping or actually making purchases? <br>

**Average Revenue Per Person:** What’s the average amount a customer spends when they visit? Are we getting just coffee or adding those delicious pastries to the mix? <br>

**Average Order Per Person:** How much is each person buying per visit? Are people sticking to single items or indulging in full meals? <br>

## 5. 🔍 Detailed Analysis & Creative Business Insights <br>
<br>

**1. Monthly Revenue** <br>
Insight: Sales peak during the winter months, suggesting that cozy drinks like hot chocolate and chai tea become fan favorites during colder weather.<br>
Recommendation: Launch seasonal promotions around popular drinks, offering limited-time flavors or deals during the colder months.<br>
<br>

**2.⏱ Hourly Orders & Revenue** <br>
Insight: Early morning (7–9 AM) is the busiest time—no surprise here, people need their coffee fix! But interestingly, there’s a second smaller rush between 2–4 PM, likely the post-lunch, mid-afternoon pick-me-up.<br>
Recommendation: Maximize staffing during these peak hours and offer special discounts on smaller snacks or beverages during the afternoon slump to increase sales.<br>
<br>

**3.🏆 Top 3 Products by Revenue** <br>
#1 Ethiopia Rg Gourmet Coffee: This premium brew brings in the most revenue.<br>
#2 Spicy Eye Opener Chai: People love their chai with a kick—perfect for starting the day strong!<br>
#3 Dark Chocolate Hot Chocolate: A top contender, especially popular during cooler months.<br>
Recommendation: Stock up on these winners and feature them more prominently in marketing efforts, as they drive a big portion of the revenue.<br>
<br>

**4.📊 Store-wise Revenue & Footfall** <br>
Insight: The Lower Manhattan location consistently outperforms others in terms of footfall and revenue, likely due to its high-traffic location.<br>
Recommendation: Invest in advertising or loyalty programs specific to this store to capitalize on its high performance. Alternatively, investigate underperforming locations and consider changes in marketing strategy or product offerings.<br>

#### And that’s the scoop! I might expand this into the future and include more insights as I expand my skillset.
