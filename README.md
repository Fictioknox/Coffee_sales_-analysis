# â˜• Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (2023) ðŸ“Š

### Welcome to the ultimate breakdown of our coffee shopâ€™s sales data!
In this project, I brewed up some powerful insights and stirred in a bit of business strategy to help our favorite coffee spot thrive! Here's a quick overview of the project and how I percolated through the data to uncover meaningful results. Grab a cup of your favorite brew, and letâ€™s get started!

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to uncover key business insights from the coffee shopâ€™s sales data. I wanted to dig deeper into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends to brew up recommendations that can:

Boost revenue <br>
Optimize product offerings <br>
Improve customer experience <br>
Maximize store efficiency <br>

Whether itâ€™s figuring out the best times to brew more coffee or highlighting star products, this analysis brings a full-flavored understanding of the shopâ€™s operations!

## 2. ðŸ“‹ Understanding the Data
Our dataset is like a perfectly crafted latteâ€”itâ€™s got all the good stuff! Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s in it:

__Transactions:__   Every sale, large or small, across different stores. <br>

**Dates & Times:** When each cup was soldâ€”useful for identifying daily trends and rush hours. <br>

**Product Details:** From gourmet coffee to baked goods, each item has its own identity. <br>

**Locations:** Multiple stores across different areas, giving us a sense of regional performance. <br>

This rich data set is a goldmine for uncovering patterns in customer behavior and store efficiency.

## 3. ðŸ”§ Challenges Faced
Here are some challenges I tackled:

**Editing Formats:** Standardizing date and time formats to make sure everything was in sync.<br>

**Handling Missing Values:** Like finding a misplaced sugar packet, I filled the gaps where needed and checked for any null values. (because bad data leads to bad brews).<br>

**Data Cleaning:** We removed any duplicates and irrelevant info to ensure we were working with clean, high-quality dataâ€”just like a well-brewed cup of coffee.<br>

## 4. ðŸ“ˆ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
I focused on key metrics that give a snapshot of the shopâ€™s overall performance. Hereâ€™s what I measured:

**Total Sales:** The shop's lifeblood, broken down across time frames (monthly, daily, etc.). <br>

**Total Footfall:** How many people are walking through the doors? Are they window shopping or actually making purchases? <br>

**Average Revenue Per Person:** Whatâ€™s the average amount a customer spends when they visit? Are we getting just coffee or adding those delicious pastries to the mix? <br>

**Average Order Per Person:** How much is each person buying per visit? Are people sticking to single items or indulging in full meals? <br>
